[![test](https://github.com/Unaimend/bionim/actions/workflows/main_test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Unaimend/bionim/actions/workflows/main_test.yml)

This package tries to provide a lot of the most useful data structures and alogrithms need in the different subfields of bioinformatics

The apis for most of the algorithms we be quite unstable until version 1.0.0 is reached, also this package will grrow quite a lot in the next few months

# Instalation
Requires Nim to be installed on your system. See https://nim-lang.org/

Installation with the nimble package manager is recommended:

`nimble install bionim`


# Tests
To run test just run `nimble test` in the bionim directory



Currently implemented alogrithms and data structures
In this section are all packages listed on which bionim depends and which were not created by me.
 * [PhylogeNi](https://github.com/kerrycobb/PhylogeNi) A library for working with phylogenetic trees
 
# Contributions
